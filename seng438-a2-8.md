# 1 Introduction

This lab is conducted to learn the basics of automated unit testing. In it, we:

- Create automated test code using Junit.
- Incorporate mock objects into test code development using Jmock.

In the rest of this report we describe the unit test strategy used, list the developed test cases, and provide other information about our lab experiences.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Because we are given the requirements only, white-box testing is not an option. Therefore, we apply black-box test-case design techniques such as equivalence classes and boundary value analysis. 

To find the required test cases, we first derive the domain for each input variable, then the equivalence classes. By identifying these equivalence classes, we can cover the input set with one element from each equivalence class, avoiding test redundancy. We divide inputs into legal and illegal inputs, then further subdivide into subsets on which the application behaves differently. These include null, positive, negative, and zero values.

To complement equivalence classes, we use boundary value analysis to test inputs at and near the boundaries of equivalence classes.

We test two classes from JFreeChart: Range and DataUtilities. For each function in both classes, we will list the equivalence classes and the tests written to use them.

There are benefits and drawbacks to using mocking in software testing. We use mocking to isolate components, allowing each component to be tested independently from its dependencies. However, creating and maintaining mocks present a maintenance overhead that can be time-consuming. Additionally, mocks may not accurately reflect real-world conditions.

# 3 Test cases developed

### Range

#### getCentralValue()

- centralValueShouldBeZero

#### constrain(double value)
For this functionality there are 3 equivalence classes. Input below the lower bound of the range, above the upper bound of the range and within the range. In addition there are 2 boundary cases. One where the input is equal to the lower bound and one where it is equal to the upper bound. We must test all 5 of these cases. To set up the test a range with lower bound 1.5 and upper bound 3.8 will be set up.

- lowerEqualToBoundTest: Input 1.5 should return 1.5: **Pass**
- withinBoundaryTest: input 2.0 should return 2.0: **Pass**
- upperBoundaryTest: Input 7.0 should return 3.8: **Pass**
- belowBoundaryTest: Input of 0 should return 1.5: **Fail**
- upperEqualToBoundTest: Input 3.8 should return 3.8: **Pass**

#### contains(double value)
For this functionality there are 3 equivalence classes. Input below the lower bound of the range, above the upper bound of the range and within the range. In addition there are two boundary cases. One where the input is equal to the lower bound and one where it is equal to the upper bound. We will also test any extreme cases such as a negative value or extremely large positive number. We must test all 7 of these cases. To set up the test a range with lower bound 1.5 and upper bound 3.8 will be set up.

- belowBoundaryTest: Input of 0 should return false: **Pass**
- withinBoundaryTest: Input 3.79999 should return true : **Pass**

### DataUlitities

#### calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)
For this functionality there would be three test partitions. Two to test the case of valid input: A case where all row values for a column are positive values and a case where some are negative. Another to test the case of invalid input i.e an empty Value2D. Below are our three test methods.

-calculateColumnTotalForTwoValues: test case of valid input. Value2d column 0 contains 7.5 and 2.5 so should return 10.0. : **Pass** 
-calculateColumnTotalForMultiplePosNegValues: test case of valid input. Value2d column contains -1, -2, -3.2, 4.55, -4.3 so should return 5.95. : **Pass** 
- calculateColumnTotalForEmpty: test invalid input. There are no columns so should return 0.0. : **Pass**

#### calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)
For this functionality there would be three test partitions. Two to test the case of valid input: A case where all column values for a row are positive values and a case where some are negative. Another to test the case of invalid input i.e an empty Value2D. Below are our three test methods.

-calculateRowTotalForTwoValues: test case of valid input. Value2d row 0 contains 7.5 and 2.5 so should return 10.0. : **Fail** 
-calculateRowTotalForMultiplePosNegValues: test case of valid input. Value2d row contains -1, -2, -3.2, 4.55, -4.3 so should return -5.95. : **Fail**
- calculateColumnTotalForEmpty: test invalid input. There are no columns so should return 0.0. : **Pass**

#### createNumberArray(double[] data)

There are three partitions: invalid (null) data, empty data, and non-empty data. We test non-empty data as positive and mixed (positive and negative values).

- createNumberArrayWithInvalidData: invalid (null) data should throw an InvalidParameterException. **Error (threw IllegalArgumentException instead)**
- createNumberArrayWithEmptyData: Valid and empty data should return an empty Number[]. **Pass**
- createNumberArrayWithPositveData: Input data contains {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5} so it should return the same array as a Number[]. **Fail**
- createNumberArrayWithMixedData: Input data contains {1.1, -2.2, 3.3, 4.4, -5.5} so it should return the same array as a Number[]. **Fail**

#### createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)

There are three partitions: invalid (null) data, empty data, and non-empty data. We test non-empty data as positive and mixed (positive and negative values).

- createNumberArray2DWithInvalidData: invalid (null) data should throw an InvalidParameterException. **Error (threw IllegalArgumentException instead)**
- createNumberArray2DWithEmptyData: valid and empty data should return an empty Number[][]. **Pass**
- createNumberArray2DWithPositiveData: Input data contains {
{1.1, 2.2, 3.3},
{4.4, 5.5, 6.6},
 {7.7, 8.8, 9.9}
}
 so it should return the same array as a Number[][]. **Fail**
- createNumberArray2DWithMixedData: Input data contains {
{-1.1, 2.2, 3.3},
{4.4, -5.5, 6.6},
 {7.7, 8.8, -9.9}
}
 so it should return the same array as a Number[][].**Fail**

#### getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)

There are three partitions: invalid (null) data, empty data, and non-empty data.

- getCumulativePercentagesForInvalidData: invalid (null) data should throw an InvalidParameterException. **Error (threw IllegalArgumentException instead)**
- getCumulativePercentagesForEmptyData: valid and empty data should return an empty KeyedValues. **Fail**
- getCumulativePercentagesForNonEmptyData: input KeyedValues contains key-value pairs [0: 5, 1: 9, 2: 2] so the returned KeyedValues should have pairs [0: 0.3125, 1: 0.875, 2: 1.0]. **Fail**

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

For this assignment we divided the work equally. Each of us focused on 2-3 functions to test and then peer reviewed the others.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The assignment was not too difficult for the most part, but we did run into difficulties getting familiar with the Eclipse IDE and how it integrates with Junit tests. As a group we did not attend the help lab session due to having prior Junit experience in VScode. We learned to attend the drop in help lab sessions even if we are confident in the assignment topic so that we can ask for help from the TAs and smoothen out the workflow on the assignment.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab itself was well organised and provided a good opportunity to gain familiarity with eclipse, Junit and unit testing in general. We think the lab report was alot easier to follow than the first assignment.However, the submission is a bit confusing (figuring the format of submission).
